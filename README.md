# CryptoClustering

This repo uses unsupervised machine learning to find trends in cryptocurrency values. The data, initially from a csv file, was scaled before applying the K-Means method to cluster the data. Afterwards, a PCA analysis was conducted to optimise the data. Both were plotted and results were compared.
